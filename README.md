# Web Based Dog Whistle

### Designed to be run from a RasPi so and use the 3.5mm as audio output to speakers facing the targets


1. Totally Un-necessary
2. Definitely not the best execution
3. Overall took way too long, but isn't the journey all that really matters?

## npm start runs the app
    goto: localhost:3000 for the front page
    you can play the tone as much as you want.
